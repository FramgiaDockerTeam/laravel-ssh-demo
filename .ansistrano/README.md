### Deploy Laravel Using Ansistrano

#### Usage

* Add **Drone's** project public key to github/bitbucket (scm) **Deploy keys** and Remote server file: `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
* Copy `.ansistrano` folder and `.drone.yml` to your Laravel folder.
* You have to change some configurations in the following files:
    * Hostâ€™s inventory file: `.ansistrano/production` and `.ansistrano/staging`
        * We have 2 servers: [webservers] and [dbservers] server, please change both of them (it can be the same)
        * Change IP address host, ssh user (`ansible_ssh_user`), ssh port (`ansible_ssh_port`)
    * All variables file: `.ansible/group_vars/all.yml`
        * **repository**: Github/Bitbucket (scm)
        * **branch**: Git branch name for deployment
        * **dbuser**: Database user
        * **dbname**: Database name
        * **dbpassword**: Database user's password
    * Web variables file: `.ansistrano/deploy.yml`
        * **repository**: Github/Bitbucket (scm)
        * **branch**: Git branch name for deployment
        * **shared_items**: List all items inside `shared` folder
    * Database variables file: `.ansible/group_vars/dbservers.yml`
* Commands:
    * For install `php, composer, mysql, nginx, npm, node, bower` and deploy
    ```
    ansible-playbook -i production site.yml --extra-vars='ansible_become_pass={become_password} init=yes'
    ```
    `{become_password}` is password of ssh user on server. It's Not Necessary, if ssh user is _root_
    * For only deployment without setup anything (Make sure that `php, composer, mysql, nginx, npm, node, bower` is installed)
    ```
    ansible-playbook -i production site.yml --extra-vars='ansible_become_pass={become_password}'
    ```
* Modify commands in `.drone.yml` file.
